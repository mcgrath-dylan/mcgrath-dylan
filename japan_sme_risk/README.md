# SME Risk Tracker — Japan

This project explores zombie SMEs (unprofitable firms surviving off government loan guarantees) in Japan. These entities distort credit allocation and pose long-term systemic risks, especially for regional banks.

### 📌 Why It Matters

- 💸 Zombie SMEs distort Japan’s credit markets and burden regional banks.
- 🏦 BOJ and FSA have flagged this as a growing systemic concern.
- 🎯 Goal: Identify patterns to inform smarter credit strategy before defaults occur.
