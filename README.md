# Dylan McGrath | Business Analyst → Analytics Engineering (in progress)

Turning business questions into tested, documented data models and small data apps.

## 💡 What This Repo Is
A portfolio and sandbox for practical analytics across:
- 🧠 Business analysis — SQL, BI dashboards, process improvement
- 🧱 Modern data stack — Snowflake + dbt (modeling, tests, docs, lineage)
- 🧰 Lightweight data apps — Streamlit/LLM where they speed up insight
- 🔎 Risk & operations — transparency, controls, decision support

Building an AE toolkit (Snowflake + dbt) on top of BA experience. Projects focus on real pain points and shippable tools, not just experiments.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Loan Default ML Demo
**Problem:** Many public default prediction models leak future data or overfit.  
**Solution:** Clean, reproducible pipeline using only origination-time features to predict charge-offs in LendingClub data. Streamlit app for interactive thresholds.
