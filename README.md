## 💡 What This Repo Is

This is a portfolio and sandbox for fintech experiments at the intersection of:

- 🧠 Business analysis (SQL, Power BI, automation)
- 🤖 Machine learning modeling and deployment (scikit-learn, Streamlit)

- 🔎 Regulatory and risk transparency (RegTech, credit policy, and beyond)

Projects here focus on identifying real-world pain points and building practical tools to address them.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Loan Default ML Demo

**Problem:** Many public default prediction models leak future data or overfit. This project creates a clean, reproducible pipeline using only origination-time features to predict loan charge-offs in LendingClub data.

**Solution:**  
- Three-stage pipeline (trim → EDA → modeling)  
- Streamlit app to demo predictions with adjustable threshold slider  
- Completed end-to-end in under two weeks
