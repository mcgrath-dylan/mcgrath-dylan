**Focus:** SME credit risk in Japan, banking inefficiencies, and RegTech insights.

## 🚧 Active Project: SME Risk Tracker  
**Context:** The Bank of Japan and FSA have raised concerns about zombie SMEs—unprofitable businesses surviving off government guarantees. These firms distort credit allocation and pose long-term risk to regional banks.

**What I’m Building:**  
- A Power BI prototype to flag at-risk SMEs based on key financial signals (e.g. negative margins + credit guarantees).  
- Grounded in BOJ/FSA data, using synthetic loan datasets.  
- Goal: validate interest from analysts or institutions before scaling further.

📂 Coming soon: `/japan_sme_risk/` (dashboard screenshots + source notes)

## 🎯 Repo Purpose  
This repo is a sandbox for fintech experiments that combine:  
- Data storytelling (Power BI, SQL)  
- Japanese regulatory insight  
- Risk transparency in SME finance  

As the project evolves, this will expand into live dashboards, BOJ-aligned commentary, and outreach-ready prototypes.
