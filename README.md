# Dylan McGrath | Business Analyst → Analytics Engineering

Turning business questions into tested, documented data models and small data apps.

## 💡 What This Repo Is

A portfolio and sandbox for practical analytics across:

* 🧠 Business analysis — SQL, BI dashboards, process improvement
* 🧱 Modern data stack — Snowflake + dbt (modeling, tests, docs, lineage)
* 🧰 Lightweight data apps — Streamlit/LLM where they speed up insight
* 🔎 Risk & operations — transparency, controls, decision support

Building an AE toolkit (Snowflake + dbt) on top of BA experience. Projects focus on real pain points and shippable tools, not just experiments.

## 🚀 Featured Project: FinOps for Snowflake + dbt (Starter)

**Problem:** Teams struggle to see a clean, credible picture of Snowflake spend and where idle waste hides.
**Solution:** A dbt-powered FinOps starter with a Streamlit UI: authoritative MTD spend, monthly forecast, **Idle Wasted (last N days)**, trends and top tables. Pro add-on (private) unlocks **Idle projected (monthly)** and a **Pro Insights** table with warehouse-level opportunities.

🔎 Tech: Snowflake ACCOUNT\_USAGE sources, dbt Core (tests/docs/lineage), Streamlit app, optional Pro gating
