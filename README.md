# Dylan McGrath | Fintech Business Analyst

Exploring inefficiencies, regulatory gaps, and storytelling in global finance.

## 💡 What This Repo Is

This is a portfolio and sandbox for fintech experiments built at the intersection of:

- 🧠 Business analysis (SQL, Power BI, automation)
- 📊 Data visualization for financial decision-making
- 🔎 Regulatory and risk transparency (RegTech, credit policy, and beyond)

Projects here focus on identifying real-world pain points, especially where legacy systems or unclear rules create opportunity.

## 🚧 Featured Project: SME Risk Tracker – Japan

**Problem:** Zombie SMEs (unprofitable businesses propped up by government guarantees) remain a risk to Japan’s regional banking system (per BOJ/FSA).

**Solution:**  
- A Power BI dashboard simulating a risk triage tool for SME portfolios  
- Built on synthetic data but grounded in BOJ/FSA reporting
- Designed to spark conversations with analysts, not solve everything up front
